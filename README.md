DS3231RTC
=========

Basic sketch for the DS3231 Real Time Clock

This sketch shows hot to read from and write to the device registers, how to set the time, date, and year, how to read time, date, and year, and how to display all on a Nokia 5110 68 x 84 pixel display. Also shown is the use of the two RTC alarms with either status register polling or hardware interrupt. There is an ATMEL 32Kbyte EEPROM on the ZS-042 breakout board used here that could be used for data logging and/or to store alarm sound. I will add use of this EEPROM to the sketch in the next update.
